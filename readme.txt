This is my first mini project, done between semesters.
The goal is to get warmed up and getting used to getting some work doneon my own besides my academic studies.
This program is a basic sudoku puzzle solver, using a backtracking algorithm.
.Algorithm's time complexity is : O(n ^ m) where n is the number of possibilities for each square (9 in classic Sudoku) and m is the number of spaces that are blank.
